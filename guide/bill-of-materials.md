Moving Rainbow Bill of Materials
==============

We encourage everyone to purchase one device from (or make a donation to) the fine people at [Arduino.org](http://arduino.org) and [Arudino.cc](Arduino.cc).  It is their efforts that have produced the popular tools that we use to program our chips.

We also want to thank the people at Adafruit for writing the NeoPixel driver libraries.

Here are some of the parts you can purchase on-line:

LED Strips
----------
All the addressible LED strips are based on the very popular WS-2812B chip.  The tape comes in 30, 60 or 144 LEDs per meter, in white and black background and with and without water-resistent silicon wrapper.  For the kits I use the 60 LEDs per meter and a black background.

[NeoPixels from Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1461)  The prices on the Adafruit site have been about $25/meter without shipping.

[Generic WS-2812B Addressable LED Strip](http://www.ebay.com/itm/271630703951?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649)  The prices are about $17/meter for the 60 LEDs per meter.  They tend to take about two weeks to arrive.

My standard kits use 12 pixels.  This is just enough to do a clock, but it keeps the costs down to about $3.00 per kit.  If budgets are a problem 10 pixels will work, just remember to change the headers in the sample code.

Arduino Nano
----------
[Arduino Nano on Arduino.cc](http://arduino.org/products/arduino-nano)

To find the best price I usually go to EBay.com and search for "Arduino Nano V3.0".  Make sure you do not get a "pro mini" versions that has no USB conector.
[Sample Link on E-Bay}(http://www.ebay.com/itm/1Pcs-XTWduino-Nano-V3-0-ATMEGA328P-Improve-Board-Moudle-for-Arduino-No-USB-Cable-/301397796552).  The prices as of April 2015 was $2.89 with shipping and it takes about 4 weeks to ship from China.

You can also get this with a short USB cable for about $5.00, however the USB cable is a bit short.

You can also get a full size Arduino Uno from the Microcenter in St. Louis Park for $9.99 + tax.

USB Cable
----------

Make sure you get a connector that matches your Arduino.  Most of the Nano's use a "Mini-B" connector.

Solderless Breadboards
----------
I usually include the 400 tie point solderless breadboard in the kits.  It is enough room for most projects and it fits in the standard box.

Boxes
-----
I have tried dozens of boxes and the one that students like the most are the clear polystyrene boxes that are 8-1/4" long.  You can get these at The Continer Store for $3.99 earch.  If you search for "Shallow Narrow Stackable Rectangle Clear" you will find them.  The link is [here](http://www.containerstore.com/shop?productId=10032168) The dimensions are. 8-1/4" x 3-1/2" x 1-1/2" h.  Note that this box is an ideal size for students to put in their backbacks, take to school and show their friends.  This is critical for the "viral" nature of the these kits.  The more other kids seem them the more the show their friends.

One other lower-cost option is to just get the plastic "shoe box" containers from a local retailer.  These are larger, not as clear but lower cost.  I can usually find them for under $1.00.

Other students have found left-over containers at places like the dollar store.  Look for clear versions that you can drill holes into.

Other Optional Parts
===================
Many of my kits also have a power switch, a rest button and a "mode selection" dial.  Hooking these up is a bit more challenging,since there are 7 additional wires used.

On-off switch
-----------
[10 SPST Toggle Switchs](http://www.ebay.com/itm/10PCS-Blue-MTS-102-3-Pin-SPDT-ON-ON-6A-125VAC-Mini-2-Position-Toggle-Switches-/261497498956) You can get 10 for $3.24 with shipping.  This is about 1/3 of prices on other sites.

Mode Selector
-------------
[Rotery Encoder Push Button Switch](http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-10pcs-12mm-Rotary-Encoder-Push-Button-Switch-Keyswitch-Electronic-Components-/331262931119) You can get 10 of them for around $5.00

Rest Buttons
-----------
[Momentary Push Buttons](http://www.ebay.com/itm/10PCS-Mini-Push-Button-PushButton-Boat-Momentary-OFF-ON-Switch-7mm-Red-/251757733306) I found 10 fo them for $3.67 with shipping.
