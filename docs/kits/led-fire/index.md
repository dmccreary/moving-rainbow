# LED Fire Kit

This $10 kit uses a NeoPixel ring to simulate a small tabletop fire.  It uses
a NeoPixel ring ($5), a low-cost (4) Raspberry Pi Pico, a breadboard, some wires
and a power supply.  The power supply can be a battery pack with 3 AA batteries
or a 5v USB wall adapter.

If you don't have a breadboard you can solder the components together on a perfboard.
