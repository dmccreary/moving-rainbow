## About This Graph

This learning graph maps out all the key concepts covered in the Moving Rainbow curriculum, organized into 13 categories:

- **Computer Fundamentals (CF)** - Basic computer operations and file management
- **Mathematics (MATH)** - Number systems, arithmetic, and mathematical concepts
- **LED Concepts (LED)** - Color theory, RGB models, and LED fundamentals
- **Electronics (ELEC)** - Circuits, voltage, current, and electrical safety
- **Power and Batteries (POWR)** - Battery selection, power management, and energy optimization
- **Microcontroller (MCU)** - Raspberry Pi Pico and microcontroller basics
- **Programming (PROG)** - Python syntax, variables, functions, and control structures
- **Input/Buttons (INPUT)** - Button handling, debouncing, and event-driven programming
- **Animation (ANIM)** - LED animation patterns and timing concepts
- **Architecture (ARCH)** - Code organization and design patterns
- **Debugging (DEBUG)** - Error handling and troubleshooting techniques
- **Project Design (DESIGN)** - Planning, prototyping, and iterative development
- **Professional Skills (PROF)** - Documentation, version control, and presentation

## How to Use

- **Click and drag** to explore the graph
