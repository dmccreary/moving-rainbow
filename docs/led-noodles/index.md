# LED Noodles

LED Noodles are flexible LEDs that can be used
in costumes and other wearable items.

## Static Circuits

Our first section gives you recipes for simple
LED Noodle circuits using a variety of battery
packs and USB power packs.  The circuits are
simple and just are turned on and off.  They
are ideal for beginner projects that focus on
how the LEDs are used with flexible fabric and
clothing.

## LED Noodle Dimmer

These LED Noodles can get very bright in a dark room.
Many of our users want to control how bright they are
on a costume.  To do this we created a simple LED
dimmer circuit using a potentiometer.

## LED Noodle Nightlight

This fun project makes our LED Noodle only turn on
when it is dark.  This is perfect for a nightlight.

## Dynamic Circuits

Once you are familiar with how LED Noodles are
powered on, you can take the next step and power
them by microcontrollers like the Raspberry Pi
Pico.  These projects allow you to not only
control the brightness of a single LED Noodle
but also allow the LED Noodles to sequently
light up in waves.
