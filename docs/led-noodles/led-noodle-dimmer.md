# LED Noodle Dimmer

LED noodles can be very bright.  When used in a costume at
a party in a dark room, the brightness can been overwhelming!
To be attractive, the brightness of the LEDs need to be turned
down.

In this lesson, we will use a potentiometer to change
the brightness of one or more LED noodles.  We
will start using a simple potentiometer in series
with the LED and then move on to circuits with
finer grain of control.

!!! Warning
    Be carful when you are adjusting the resistance of
    these circuits.  We never want the current limiting
    resistor to go to zero.  That will burn out the LED
    noodle.  We suggest ALWAYS having a 15 ohm resistor
    in series with the LED noodle so you don't accidentally
    burn it out using a 5 volt power supply.
