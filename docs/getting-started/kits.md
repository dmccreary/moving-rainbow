Our standard kit contains the following parts:

1. A Raspberry Pi Pico ($4)
2. A 1/2 size solderless breadboard (400 ties) ($2)
3. A 30-pixel addressable RGB LED strip (WS2812B) ($2)
4. 3 terminal screw header (optional)
5. Two momentary push buttons
6. 22 gauge wires

Classroom will also have the right USB cables for these boards.  If you have a PC or a Mac you will need a USB-A-to-micro-USB or for a Mac you will need USB-C-to micro-USB connector.

If you are using these kits to make a costume, you can also purchase a battery pack that holds 3 AA batteries or a USB power pack used to recharge phones.  We find that even the small 2,500 milliamp hour packs will power a costume of 60 LEDs for many hours (depending on the brightness of the pattern)
