Our standard kit contains the following parts:

1. A Raspberry Pi Pico ($4) or "W" ($6) with header pins soldered in place

## USB Connectors

Most of our classrooms will also have the right USB cables for these boards.  If you have a PC or a Mac you will need a USB-A-to-micro-USB or for a Mac, you will need USB-C-to-micro-USB connector.

## Batteries and Battery Packs

If you are using these kits to make a costume, you can also purchase a battery pack that holds 3 AA batteries or a USB power pack used to recharge phones.  We find that even the small 2,500 milliamp hour packs will power a costume of 60 LEDs for many hours (depending on the brightness of the pattern)

## LED Strip and Rings

There are hundreds of variations of WS2812B LED strips and fairy lights.  We usually purchase them in 1-meter strips with 60 pixels per meter.  Since 2020 there are now very lightweight fairy lights that are ideal for lighting up costumes.

If you are creating costumes that might get wet in the rain, we suggest getting the versions that are encased in a waterproof silicon tube or in a waterproof silicon coating.
