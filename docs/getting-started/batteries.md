## LiPo Battery Charging Modules

Many of our projects use rechargeable LiPo
batteries.  However, we can't just plug these
into a 5v source to recharge them.  We need
a small circuit that will do two things:

1. Limit the current that goes into the batter when charging
2. Cut off the battery when it is draining to make sure
that it does not fully drain the battery.  Draining a LiPo
battery fully can reduce it's recharging potential

There are two main types of battery charing boards
that we use in our projects.  They
have different power ratings.
They both cost around $1 on eBay.

## TC4056 1 Amp LiPo Battery Charger

This is the most common and is fine for most
projects that don't need high current for fast
recharging. It is called a "linear charger"

## IP2312 3 Amp LiPo Battery Charger

The IP2312 is a higher power version of the charger.
It is used when you have larger batteries and want
faster charging.

I'd be happy to compare the TC4056 and IP2312 LiPo battery management boards for powering LED strips. Let me search for the most up-to-date information about these boards to give you an accurate comparison.

## TC4056 vs IP2312 LiPo Battery Management Boards Comparison

Based on my research, here's a detailed comparison of the TC4056 and IP2312 LiPo battery management boards for powering LED strips:

### TC4056 Overview

The TC4056 (also known as TP4056) is a widely used linear charging controller IC for single-cell lithium-ion/LiPo batteries with the following characteristics:

- Uses constant-current/constant-voltage (CC/CV) charging method
- Maximum charging current of 1A, programmable through an external resistor (Rprog)
- Fixed charging voltage of 4.2V
- Thermal feedback to automatically adjust charging current to limit chip temperature
- Input voltage range of 4V-8V, making it compatible with USB power

Protection features (when paired with protection circuits like DW01A):
- Overcharge protection (safely charges to 4.2V)
- Overcurrent and short-circuit protection
- Trickle charge for battery reconditioning

### IP2312 Overview

The IP2312 is a newer alternative battery management IC with key differences:

- Uses synchronous switch step-down (buck converter) charging architecture
- Maximum charging current of 3A (three times that of TC4056)
- Very high charging efficiency of 94% at 3.7V/2A
- Integrates all protection features in a single IC
- Operating frequency of 750KHz
- Supports intelligent current adjustment to prevent pulling on adapters

### Key Differences

#### 1. Charging Efficiency and Heat Dissipation

- **TC4056:** Uses linear voltage regulation which dissipates excess energy as heat, making it less efficient. This leads to significant heat generation during charging, particularly at higher currents.

- **IP2312:** Uses a buck converter architecture rather than linear regulation, achieving 94% conversion efficiency. This results in very little heat production even when charging at full potential.

#### 2. Maximum Charging Current

- **TC4056:** Limited to 1A maximum charging current.

- **IP2312:** Supports up to 3A charging current, making it suitable for larger capacity batteries or faster charging.

#### 3. Integration

- **TC4056:** Typically requires additional ICs (like DW01A and 8205A) for complete battery protection.

- **IP2312:** Has all protection features integrated in a single IC, simplifying board design and reducing component count.

#### 4. Real-world Performance

In direct comparisons:
- The IP2312 produces much less heat than the TC4056 when charging at comparable currents
- The IP2312's charging current gradually reduces as battery voltage increases, starting at maximum when the battery is fully discharged and then reducing to a nominal value of 1.5-1A

### Pros and Cons for LED Strip Power Applications

#### TC4056

**Pros:**
- Widely available and very inexpensive
- Simple circuit design
- Well-documented with extensive community support
- Adequate for smaller LED strips with lower power requirements
- Works well with USB power sources

**Cons:**
- Significant heat generation limits practical charging current
- Lower efficiency means wasted power
- May require heat sinks for sustained operation
- Not ideal for high-power LED strips due to current limitations
- Should not be used to simultaneously charge a battery and power a load

#### IP2312

**Pros:**
- Much higher efficiency (94%) means less wasted power
- Minimal heat generation even at high currents
- Higher charging current (up to 3A) supports larger batteries
- All-in-one solution with integrated protection
- Better suited for high-power LED strip applications

**Cons:**
- Less widely available than TC4056
- Typically more expensive
- Less community documentation and support
- More complex implementation

### Tradeoffs for Powering LED Strips

When powering LED strips from LiPo batteries, these tradeoffs are important to consider:

1. **Power Requirements:** For high-power LED strips (>1A), the IP2312 is clearly superior due to its higher current capability and efficiency.

2. **Heat Management:** The TC4056's heat generation can be problematic in enclosed spaces or when powering LED strips for extended periods, while the IP2312's higher efficiency results in cooler operation.

3. **Battery Life:** The IP2312's higher efficiency translates to less energy wasted during charging, potentially extending battery life and providing more power to your LED strips.

4. **Cost vs Performance:** The TC4056 is adequate and cost-effective for smaller, lower-power LED strips, while the IP2312 is worth the additional cost for high-power applications or where efficiency is critical.

5. **Simultaneous Operation:** If you need to power LED strips while charging the battery, the IP2312 is better suited due to its design, although proper circuit design is still important.

In conclusion, for powering LED strips, the IP2312 offers superior performance, particularly for high-brightness or extended use cases, while the TC4056 remains a viable economical option for lower-power applications where maximum efficiency isn't critical.
