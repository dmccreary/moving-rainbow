## About the Moving Rainbow Project

Moving Rainbow is a way to learn the basics of programming using fun LED strips.  
We use low-cost components so you can build entire projects and costumes with 
100s of colorful LEDs for under $10.
Since 2014 we have been designing and programming low-cost kits that teach the concepts 
of [Computational Thinking](./teachers-guide/computational-thinking.md).

## Getting Started

Our getting [started guide](./getting-started/index.md) has several parts:

1. About Moving Rainbow
1. Sample Hardware Kits
1. Lessons
2. Building Your Own Kits from Parts
3. Desktop Setup

## Other Resources

See our [Teachers Guide](./teachers-guide/index.md) for anyone teaching students about computational thinking.

See our incredible [Glossary](./glossary.md) for over 200 terms and examples of how we use these terms in this course.

!!! Note
    We are no longer accepting pull requests for Arduino C code.  Because we can get Raspberry Pi Pico processors for $4 that run Python we have moved
    all our Moving Rainbow code over to Python.
