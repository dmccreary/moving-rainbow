# Moving Rainbow: Computational Thinking with LED Programming

## Course Overview

**Course Code:** CS-110
**Grade Level:** 10th Grade (Sophomores)
**Duration:** 10 weeks (1 semester)
**Credit:** 0.5 Credit (Elective - Computer Science/STEM)
**Prerequisites:** None - No prior programming experience required
**Materials Fee:** $10 (students keep their kit)

## Course Description

Moving Rainbow is a hands-on introduction to computer science and computational thinking through the creation of colorful LED animations and wearable electronics. Students will learn Python programming by controlling addressable LED strips with Raspberry Pi Pico microcontrollers, progressing from simple blinking patterns to complex, interactive light displays.

This project-based course emphasizes the four pillars of computational thinking: decomposition (breaking problems into manageable parts), pattern recognition (identifying similarities), abstraction (focusing on important details), and algorithm design (creating step-by-step solutions). Students will develop these critical thinking skills while building engaging projects they can take home and share with family and friends.

The course culminates in a three-week capstone project where students design, program, and present an original LED creation of their choice, such as a wearable costume, room decoration, interactive art installation, or practical device like a smart nightlight.
