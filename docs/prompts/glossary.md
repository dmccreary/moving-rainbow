# Glossary Prompt

!!! prompt
     Please read through all the markdown content on this site (**/*.md) and gnerate a 
    new glossary.md file using around 200 terms that a typical junior high-school student 
    might not understand.  After each term, add an example of how that term might be used.
    Create a definition that is:

    1. precise
    2. concise
    3. distinct
    4. non-circular
    5. Do not place any specific business rules in the definition.

    When appropriate, give an example of how this term is used in the course. Return each 
    concept label in Markdown level four "####" and the definition for the term in the 
    body text. 
    
    Use "\n\n**Example:** " (using actual newline characters) before the example, but do not put a newline after the colon.

    Return the entire glossary of terms in a single markdown file.

    Place "# Moving Rainbow Glossary of Terms" at the top of the file.

    Return the terms in alphabetical order.
