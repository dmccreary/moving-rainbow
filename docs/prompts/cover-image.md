  Prompt:

  A vibrant, joyful scene of diverse children (ages 8-14) in a bright,
  modern makerspace classroom, enthusiastically working with colorful LED
  projects. In the foreground, a smiling girl wearing a festive hat with a
  glowing rainbow LED strip wrapped around it, showing pure delight as the
  LEDs cycle through brilliant colors. Next to her, a boy proudly holds up a
  breadboard with a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller connected to a strip
  of NeoPixel LEDs displaying a moving rainbow pattern. In the background,
  other children are working on various LED projects: one child wearing LED
  "noodle" lights as a glowing necklace, another attaching LED strips to a
  costume piece, and two kids collaborating over a laptop showing colorful
  Python code.

  The LED strips should display vivid, eye-catching patterns: rainbow
  gradients, moving waves of color, twinkling effects, and pulsing
  animations in reds, blues, greens, purples, and oranges. Small
  breadboards, colorful jumper wires, and Raspberry Pi Pico boards should be
  visible on the workbenches.

  The atmosphere is warm, encouraging, and filled with the soft glow of
  multicolored LEDs illuminating excited faces. The overall mood should
  convey: hands-on learning, creativity, computational thinking, accessible
  technology, and pure fun. The lighting should have a magical quality from
  the numerous glowing LED projects, creating a rainbow of reflections and
  ambient colored light throughout the space.

  Style: Bright, colorful, kid-friendly illustration or high-quality
  photograph with an optimistic, educational technology aesthetic. The image
   should feel welcoming, inspiring, and show that coding and electronics
  can be playful and accessible to everyone.
