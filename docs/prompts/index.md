# Sample Generative AI Prompts

If you want to use generative AI to write sample code for you, here is a list
of prompts you can use to generate sample Moving Rainbow code.

We encourage you to specific the following config.py file in your prompts:

`config.py`
```python
NEOPIXEL_PIN = 0
NUMBER_PIXELS = 30
BUTTON_PIN_1 = 14
BUTTON_PIN_2 = 15
```

If you do this, then all your examples will run without having
to hard-code the configuration within your code.
