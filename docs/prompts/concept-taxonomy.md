Now lets focus again on the 400 concepts we have generated in /data/learning-graph.csv.
Your next task is to organize these concepts into a small taxonomy of approximately 12 classifiers.  
You will add a new column to the csv file called taxonomyID.  
Each concept will be assigned the taxonomyID.

Your fist task is to find about 12 logical groupings of similar concepts
such as "Programming Concepts".  For each concept you will assign a
taxonomyID.

Here are some suggestions.  Here are some suggestions:

"Computer Fundamentals"
"Electronic Circuits"
"Physical Computing"
"Microcontrollers"
"Programming"
"LEDs"
"Patterns"
"Sensors"
"Debugging"
"Design"
"Projects"


Your task is to create the rest of the classifiers and give each classifier 
a label and definition.
Each category should include concepts that share similar characteristics, functions, or applications.
Attempt to evenly divide the 400 concepts into a balanced taxonomy.
