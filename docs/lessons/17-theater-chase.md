Theater [Chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_(lighting)) is a classic pattern that was popularized in [marquee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquee_(structure)) signs above movie theaters.  It consists of a row of lights that were usually switched on and off so it would appear that the lights were moving or being chased around the edge of the signs.
