## 🎯 Project Philosophy  

### Why LED Strips?

This project emerged from a simple observation: traditional breadboard circuits with multiple RGB LEDs often frustrate beginners with complex wiring. Addressable LED strips solve this with just **three wires** while delivering spectacular visual results that keep students engaged.

### Educational Approach

- **🔄 Immediate feedback**: See your code changes instantly in colorful light
- **📈 Progressive complexity**: Start with blink, advance to complex animations
- **🎨 Creative expression**: Students build projects they're excited to show friends
- **🔧 Transferable skills**: Loops and conditionals apply beyond LEDs

### Real-World Testing

Our curriculum has been refined through hundreds of hours of classroom testing across multiple CoderDojo sessions worldwide. This isn't just theory—it's proven pedagogy that works with real students and real constraints.

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

| Component | Cost | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Raspberry Pi Pico | ~$4 | Microcontroller brain |
| WS2812B LED Strip (60 pixels) | ~$5 | Addressable RGB display |
| Breadboard + Jumper Wires | ~$3 | Connections |
| Push Buttons (optional) | ~$1 | User interaction |
| **Total** | **~$13** | **Complete kit** |

> 💡 **Compatibility**: Works with any Raspberry Pi Pico and WS2812B-compatible LED strip
